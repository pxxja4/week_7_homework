# create class. A class is a blueprint/ template
# create objects of the class type -> instantiate
# class have 2 things: DATA and BEHAVIOUR
# data aka attributes or properties
# behaviour aka methods
# a method is just a function that belongs to a class
# example: student class
# data: firstname, lastname, email, cohort_number NOUNS
# behaviour: attend_learning_session, book_timeslot VERB

# if we do not say what 'kind of' class our class is
# it implicitly inherits from 'object'. There is a class in python called object

# f for field - piece of data/ coloumn

# self is implicitly passed in
# takes 3 arguments and then assigns them to a field in box of memory
# underscores have significance to python - visibility outside of the class
# class is capsule. Do we need to be inside capsule to see the stuff or can we be outside and still see it
# hiding things - which is good. Making things less complex. From design perspective, less outside world sees and depends on it
# don't want outside world to poke/ prod at code. can't refactor stuff if they are using it
# encaspulate: no underscore, 1 or 2
# no underscore  - public - can be changed by outside world
# single underscore: semi private (protected)
# double underscore: private

# getters enable READ access to fields
# setters enable WRITE access to fields
# balance is hidden, we can't let people change their own balances. Users can only read their balance so only make getter
# setter and no getter - eg doing exam, can write and submit but not view answers

    # getters might also contain translation logic
    # eg vehicle - speed mph, but in europe want to see in kph - translate to how its seen by user

        # exceptions are usually something exceptional (bad) has happened. Need option to deal with it
